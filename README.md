# TinyToreroShell
- Implement a Linux shell program named TTSH (short for Tiny Torero Shell). TTSH should support the following:

- Executing simple commands run in the foreground (e.g. ls -l)

- Executing simple commands run in the background (e.g. ./siesta &)

- Exiting the shell with the built-in exit command.

- Displaying a list of recently executed commands using the built-in history command. history will print out the N most recently entered command lines by the user (and each oneâ€™s command ID).
